# Simple Raytracer

## Description
This project is simple raytracer made in C++. I made this project in order to test my knowledge of the basics of graphics programming and the 3D math that occurs behind the scenes. I also wanted to see how much I could accomplish without having to dive into any outside APIs or use any shader languages. Although simple, the raytracer is able to produce raytraced images of spheres following the Phong Shading Model with reflections and shadows. The program will output the desired image out as a ppm so you may need a third party application to view it or convert it to a more commonly viewed format. I was heavily inspired by Dmitry V. Sokolov and his simple raytracer tutorial to do this project so please check out his github page in the references. This project will be discontinued in order for me to move onto learning more about real-time rendering within windows.
